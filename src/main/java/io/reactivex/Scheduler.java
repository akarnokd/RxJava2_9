     * <p>

     * {@link Completable}s is onNext'd to the combinator to be flattened. If
     * the inner {@link Flowable} is not immediately subscribed to an calls to
     * {@link Worker#schedule} are buffered. Once the {@link Flowable} is
     * subscribed to actions are then onNext'd as {@link Completable}s.
     * <p>
     * Finally the actions scheduled on the parent {@link Scheduler} when the
     * inner most {@link Completable}s are subscribed to.
     * <p>
     * When the {@link Worker} is unsubscribed the {@link Completable} emits an

     *  // use merge max concurrent to limit the number of concurrent
     *  // callbacks two at a time

     * });
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * This is a slightly different way to limit the concurrency but it has some
     * interesting benefits and drawbacks to the method above. It works by
     * limited the number of concurrent {@link Worker}s rather than individual
     * actions. Generally each {@link Flowable} uses its own {@link Worker}.
     * This means that this will essentially limit the number of concurrent
     * subscribes. The danger comes from using operators like
     * {@link Flowable#zip(org.reactivestreams.Publisher, org.reactivestreams.Publisher, io.reactivex.functions.BiFunction)} where
     * subscribing to the first {@link Flowable} could deadlock the
     * subscription to the second.
     * 
     * <pre>
     * Scheduler limitScheduler = Schedulers.computation().when(workers -&gt; {
     *  // use merge max concurrent to limit the number of concurrent

     * Slowing down the rate to no more than than 1 a second. This suffers from
     * the same problem as the one above I could find an {@link Flowable}
     * operator that limits the rate without dropping the values (aka leaky
     * bucket algorithm).
     * 
     * <pre>
     * Scheduler slowScheduler = Schedulers.computation().when(workers -&gt; {
